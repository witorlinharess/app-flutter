# Flutter Project: To-Do List App

## Project Description

This is a simple to-do list application built with Flutter. The main goal of this project is to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental concepts of the framework, such as state management, the use of essential widgets (`ListView`, `TextFormField`, etc.), and user interface organization.

The application will allow the user to:
- Add new tasks.
- View a list of all tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
- Delete tasks from the list.
